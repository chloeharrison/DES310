							<h2>Week 1</h2>
							<h6>INTRODUCTION;BRIEF; HTML IS A DESIGN ELEMENT</h6>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
						<h3>Learning Summary</h3>
						<p>This week we had our introduction into Narrative and Storytelling. This introduction included what would be done in the next 12 weeks to come and what would be asked of us. We talked about the outline of the module and about that this module is worth 20 credits.With te website worth 60% and the research 40%. 
We briefly went over HTML getting a quick refresh, and stressing that it is a design element. We where assigned to do a markup of text that was about a bird in New Zealand. All we had to do was very simply get the text formatted into HTML, in doing this got us back into motion with HTML. This is to prepare us for the next oncoming weeks as this Bird Project was going to be our final piece in week 12. We will then add our own design to this week by week to then get a final outcome with all that we have learnt included in the Bird Project.</p>

							<h2>Week 2</h2>
							<h6>STORIES DRIVE COMMUNICATION</h6>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
						<h3>Learning Summary</h3>
						
						<p>Stories are all around us, whether it’s the seasons changing or a stranger on a journey somewhere; they are all stories. If we are presented with something that appears to have no story, we naturally make it up, join two and two together; because it feels right and fills in what’s missing. The exact same principle applies as we surf the internet, we create our story through what we are browsing. As we go though one particular site the narrative unfolds, or we make up or own narrative as we browse from site to site. During this week’s lecture we covered the topic of the narrative experience; in other words how we experience stories and how they affect us. In Mark Bernstein's article Beyond Usability and Design: The Narrative Web for A List Apart in 2001. He wrote,
<blockquote>“The reader’s journey through our site is a narrative experience.” </blockquote></p>
 
<p>A statement that I agree with completely, each and everything we do is part of our daily story. We are so immersed by different technology these days that we are constantly on the web, subjecting us to various narratives throughout the day. 
We were given the example of maps, a very simple illustration of road layouts. Maps are tools which carry us through a journey and narrative experience as we figure out where we are going whilst taking in our surroundings. The exact same thing applies to websites; the internet is the tool that we use to carry us through a narrative experience as we take in information. 
We looked at the great storytellers of our lives, the people that convey stories in the very best and interesting ways to us. These included the following: </p>
<ol>
<li>Directors</li>
<li>Authors</li>
<li>Songwriters</li>
<li>Artists</li>
<li>Pictory</li>
 

<h4>Enacted and Emergent Narrative</h4>
<p>There are two types of narrative in interactive design:</p>
<p>Enacted narratives are those where the story itself may be structured around the user’s movement through a site and the features of the environment may react according to their actions. Websites like Amazon, EBay, or basically any shopping or service site are enacted narrative spaces. They are all sites that want the users to move through the site towards a specific set of actions like buying something or making contact with someone.</p> 
 
<p>Emergent narratives are those where spaces are designed to be rich with narrative potential, allowing users to create their own story or journey. Sites like Facebook, Flickr, Twitter, or Pinterest are emergent narrative spaces. They are all web applications that encourage their users use the tools at their disposal to tell their own story or create their own journey. The users define how they want to use the narrative space, which regularly has unexpected results. </p>

							<h2>Week 3</h2>
							<h6>SINGLE PAGE SHOWCASE</h6>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
						<h3>Learning Summary</h3>
<p>In this weeks lecture we looked at single page websites. We talked about the design of each and the elements each had within them. The ones that we looked at we talked about the narrative of the site and broke it down. Looking at the different websites gave me inspiration and ideas when thinking what type of design/structure I want for my own project. In each single page site you could see what the creator/designer was trying to convey through the style, design and structure of their site. Each had their own trend to them and they were designed in a way based around what the site was about giving a better visual impact to the user of the site.</p>

							<h2>Week 4 </h2>
							<h6>WHAT IS NARRATIVE? LEARNING FROM PRINT, MUSIC AND FILM</h6>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
						<h3>Learning Summary</h3>
                        <p>In this week's lecture we looked at other sources apart from online such as books. We learn that before we just get stuck in on the computer that it is important to plan in out, I was very familar with this has I had to do this on my placement. This weeks topic also took a look at how books tell stories. This includes the pacing. Pacing is what controls the speed a story progresses and how fast the reader is subjected to the events. When thinking of the pacing, its important to think of the type of content and the audience. For example the bird project is suppose to be informative so the pacing should be slow so that no facts are omitted. </p>
						
						<p>Also we looked at the topic of Art Direction: on paper and on Screen. The lecture began by setting the scene of going on a trip to Venice in Italy. We were shown different options of how to make that journey. For example by taking a plane with Easy-jet or taking a private jet with all the VIP treatment included. Once you arrive, would you rather stay at a basic low cost hotel or in the penthouse suite of a luxury five star hotel? The destination in both cases is identical, but the journey and the experience is what really matters. The same thing goes for user experiences within web applications. It is so important that a user has the most pleasant and easy joinery possible whilst working their way through a web application. Nobody wants to have a mediocre experience, and why should they? The internet today contains work of such high quality, if something doesn't meet their expectations they will simply move on to something that will. </p>
 
<h4>So what exactly is art direction? </h4>
<p>Art Direction is according to Typographer, Jan Tschichold, 
<blockquote>“A principle of identity between content and expression.”</blockquote>
Art direction is not always a complex procedure, a lot of the time it is very quick and simple. It can be from small things like choosing a certain filter on an image to help portray a particular mood or atmosphere to something as big as ensuring that the font of a movie poster fits in with the theme and mood of the movie. Art Direction was summed up in one quote by Tilden Freeman and Interpretive Designer 
"The chief aim of interpretation is not instruction, but provocation."
Magazine covers or movie posters are a couple of great example of art direction at work. The imagery and typography used are very important as they set the scene by creating the mood, atmosphere and perhaps making the viewer even more curious. </p>

							<h2>Week 5</h2>
							<h6>WHAT IS NARRATIVE? LEARNING FROM MUSIC AND FILM</h6>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
						<h3>Learning Summary</h3>
							<p>In this week's lecture we looked learning from music and film. Films and music follow a similar type of narrative technique to any narrative or story. Generally they all begin with a problem, have a middle and find a solution at the end, the only thing that is different is how it is delivered. Films generally follow a few different structure which are: </p>
<h4>Three-Act Structure </h4>
This is a pretty old method that is used when telling stories and is frequently used within movies, plays, poetry and novels. The general layout begins with a setup, has some form of problem within the middle and ends with a resolution. 
 <div class="gallery">
								<div>
									<div class="image fit flush">
										<a href="images/pic1.png"><img src="images/pic1.png" width="600" height="300" alt="" /></a>
									</div>
								</div>
								
       
       						</div>
<h4>Exposition </h4>
Exposition is when during the first scene of the movie all of the main characters are introduced to the viewers, during this time the plot is also uncovered. 
<h4>Climax and Resolution </h4>
This is when the final confrontation happens with the last scene, For example, the hero fighting the villain. Whatever happens during this last scene will end the film. 
  <div class="gallery">
								<div>
									<div class="image fit flush">
										<a href="images/pic2.png"><img src="images/pic2.png" width="600" height="300" alt="" /></a>
									</div>
								</div>
								
       
       						</div>
<h4>Inverted Pyramid</h4>
The Inverted pyramid is a narrative structure that is mainly used within journalism. Like a pyramid it priorities information into a triangle shape. The most important information being at the top which would be the lead of the story. This structure is commonly used for news reports within new papers because it is a useful way to structure out the information. 
  <div class="gallery">
								<div>
									<div class="image fit flush">
										<a href="images/pic3.png"><img src="images/pic3.png" width="600" height="300" alt="" /></a>
									</div>
								</div>
								
       
       						</div>
<h4>Music</h4>
Just like film, music has a structure. Generally the majority of songs begin with an intro then go into a verse and then a chorus. Musicians, like web designs structure their work, for example they will have an intro, verse and chorus whereas we would have a head, body and footer. </p>

<h4>Power of pause</h4>
<p>We learnt about the power of pause and how effective it can be in not only web design, but in everyday life. We watched a video of a machine vs a man telling a story, and there was so much emotion, pacing and was more dramatic when it was told by the man. 

A website we looked at was ‘If the moon were only 1 pixel’. It was interesting to see, and the pacing and pauses within the site were thought out very carefully. If it was too slow, or if there was too many pauses - the user would get bored very easily and most likely leave the site, but because the pacing when going from planet to planet starts off slow then speeds up, then slowing down again before coming to a pause. It is very simple but very effective. 

Another thing I found interesting was videos we watched about Steve Jobs ‘One more thing’. It was a brilliant technique he used everytime Apple released a new apple product, and kept the viewers excited to see what was coming next, even after a previous great unveiling! </p>

						<div class="content">
						<h3>Learning Summary</h3>
							<p>This week we took the time during the lecture to look at everyones styles tiles to see how everyone was getting on and what people had in mind for each of their own projects. There where some very good ideas and very intriguing designs that some people came up with, it will be good to see how their website turn out. During this critique there was confusion as people thought that they had to create a Heroes and Villians website as well as the bird project so it was decided that the main focus would be the Takahe project and to forget about the Heroes and Villians.  </p>
							
							<p>The critique was very important has this gave me an idea on were I should be which was a bit behind so this gave me the kick I needed to get the work done.</p>

							<h6>VISUAL VOCABULARY: FLAT → SKEUOMORPHIC → FLAT</h6>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<h3>Learning Summary</h3>
						<p>There was no lecture as it fell on the university's reading day but read up on the topic which is my research.But though research I realised that I am personally a big fan of flat design. I think it makes things look far more cleaner with minimalist design, a more professional look towards certain elements. The use of the flat colours instead of gradients I think has a very positive visual impact but I am starting to come round to gradients but just not too much gradient. I am going to definitely use flat design in my bird project website, you can see from my style tiles that flat design is what i want to achieve. </p>

							<h2>Week 8 </h2>
							<h6>MOVING FROM A → B: DESIGNING TRANSITIONS</h6>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
						<h3>Learning Summary</h3>
							<p>This week we looked at animations and transitions on websites and what effect it makes to the website. Animations make a website more dynamic instead of the boring old static websites. It makes it become more approach able to the user looking at it. 	
From this lecture, we realised the different ways in which we can interact with our devices. For example, desktop - we hover over something with a cursor and on mobile devices we can touch, and more recently introduced, force touch! We noticed how simple and quick we’ve learnt certain things, like we instantly pull down on our mobiles to refresh the page, we swipe to get to a new page, and we even pinch in and out to zoom in and out of images. We’ve grown to know the classic animation concepts, for example the loading symbol. No text needs to be shown, as long as we see that symbol we know whats happening! </p>


<p>Finally, in this weeks lecture we looked at the micro interactions. The aspects we looked at were very helpful as we began to add the last bits and pieces to our own websites for our assignments, these consisted of:
<ul>
<li>The Press Down Effect</li>
<li>Stateful Toggle</li>
<li>Smooth Scrolling</li>
<li>Sticky Lables</li>
<li>Creative Button Styles</li>
<li>CSS3 Animations</li>
<li>Looking at sites such as hover.css and animate.css</li>
</ul>

							<h6>THE WONDERFUL WORLD OF MAPS</h6>
						</header>
						<div class="content">

<h3>Learning Summary</h3>
<p>In this weeks lecture we looked at ‘The wonderful world of maps’. The first question we were asked was “Why use a static map when we can learn all about the wonderful world of APIs?” There is a range of different software and tools out there that can create any map design you could imagine, all with the help of APIs. Something I didn’t know which I found out in this lecture was that google fonts, typekit etc are all actually API’s! The only problem here, is that you may have to register to use certain API’s, which could be pricey and this content would be beyond your control! We were then given a list of mapping resources in which we could use in our own assignment, these included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Google Maps API</li>
<li>OpenStreet API</li>
<li>Leaflet.js</li>
<li>Mapbox Studio Classic (costs)</li>
<li>Map Styler</li>
<li>Stamen Maps</li>

							<h6>OPTIMISING FOR PERFORMANCE</h6>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
						<h3>Learning Summary</h3>
<p>This week we learnt about saving file size.The reason why we were learning about file size is because it impacts peformance of the webpage. But knowing how to reduce the file size, we can increase the performance of the webpag.
The best way to do this is to optimise things, for example:
<ul>
<li>Using jpg to decrease the file size of an image.</li>
<li>Making a webpage into a zip file to save bandwidth and increase performance time.</li>
<li>Also changing the names of certain things. For example) instead of 'background' name it 'bg' instead.</li>
<li>Using CSS minifier to reduce the file size of the CSS of a webpage</li>
<li>In 2011 the average webpage was 929KB. In 2017, it has increased to 3034KB, and most of the blame is on uncompressed images.</li>

							<h2>What is the Takahe Bird?</h2>
							<h6></h6>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
						<h3></h3>
						<p>The South Island takahē, notornis, or takahē (Porphyrio hochstetteri), is a flightless bird indigenous to New Zealand and belonging to the rail family. It was thought to be extinct after the last four known specimens were taken in 1898. However, after a carefully planned search effort the bird was rediscovered near Lake Te Anau in the Murchison Mountains, South Island, on 20 November 1948. 
The adult takahē is mainly purple-blue in color, with a greenish back and inner wings. It has a red frontal shield and red-based pink bill. The legs are pink. Sexes are similar, the females being slightly smaller, but young birds have mainly pale brown plumage. Immature birds have a pinkish bill with a bluish cast. This is a noisy species with a loud clowp call. </p>
<p>The species is still present in the location where it was rediscovered in the Murchison Mountains. Small numbers have also been successfully translocated to five predator-free offshore islands, Tiritiri Matangi, Kapiti, Maud, Mana and Motutapu, where they can be viewed by the public. As of October 2016 there were 306 takahē accounted for, showing slow but steady growth over the previous few years.
The takahē is monogamous, with pairs remaining together from 12 years to, probably, their entire lives. It builds a bulky nest under bushes and scrub, and lays one to three buff eggs. The chick survival rate is 73-97%.</p>
<p>The near-extinction of the formerly widespread takahē is due to a number of factors: over-hunting, loss of habitat and introduced predators have all played a part. The introduction of red deer (Cervus elaphus) represent a severe competition for food, while the stoats (Mustela erminea) take a role as predators. Since the species is long-lived, reproduces slowly, takes several years to reach maturity, and had a large range that has drastically contracted in comparatively few generations, inbreeding depression is a significant problem.</p>

The takahē was widely thought to be extinct but Orbell suspected it might survive. While taking time off from his Invercargill practice to search for the takahē, he discovered a set of unfamiliar footprints. After following the footprints with three companions he rediscovered the species on 20 November 1948 in a remote valley of the Murchison Mountains near Lake Te Anau.</p>

<p>Sherlock Holmes is a fictional detective of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, who first appeared in publication in 1887. He was devised by British author and physician Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. A brilliant London-based detective, Holmes is famous for his prowess at using logic and astute observation to solve cases. He is perhaps the most famous fictional detective, and indeed one of the best known and most famous literary characters. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle wrote four novels and fifty-six short-stories featuring his creation. Almost all were narrated by Holmes' friend and biographer, Dr John H. Watson, with the exception of two narrated by Holmes himself and two more written in the third person. These have been adapted into into stage and radio plays, television, films, video games, and other media for over one hundred years. With famous actors such as Robert Downey jr and Benedict Cumberbatch. </p>

							<p>As the content from the Takahe task was taken from a 1952 edition of the  National geographic Magazine, I wanted to have a closer look at their layouts and generally get an insight to the website and magazines. 
The first issue was published in 1988 and has sold many copies since worldwide. It is not only known for articles about scenery, history, the environment and the most distant corners of the world, but also its standard of photography.</p>
<p>By 1910 photographs had become the magazine’s trademark and in the early 1930′s coloured ones were introduced. Eventually these were replaced by digital photography, both for its printed magazine and its website. Throughout, the cover kept its yellow border which we all instantly recognise. Supporting the articles, the magazine sometimes provides maps of the regions visited. In our project we have been supplied with a map of New Zealand to incorporate into the website.</p>
<p>My intention is to deliver a page to get the viewer’s attention and ultimately design one that is readable, easy to navigate and be eye catching. Hence I want a simple layout and will aim to strike a balance with white space. Less is more and all that! Attention will be paid to every detail on the page - to the text the images and illustrations and the nav bar, always trying to leave space to create a good design. I want the readers eyes to be able to relax when reading the article and therefore I hope they will experience a flow from beginning to end. </p>

						<h3>Vincent Van Gogh</h3>
							<p>Artists are able to convey stories in whatever way they want. By using different mediums they are able to create wonderful art pieces that also tell a story although sometimes you really need to think about it as they aren't always clear to see. Every piece of art has a story behind it. Every brush stroke, dab of paint and each drop of colour used is a word written on the canvas. Sometimes these stories actually turn out to be more interesting than the actual art piece itself. Take a look at Vincent Van Gogh’s Portrait of Dr. Gachet. After Van Gogh was released from the asylum, he was then sent to Dr. Gachet, to ensure that he was still under supervision. Dr. Gachet was a admirier of artists at the time. After spending a few days with the doctor, Van Gogh was getting the impression that the doctor was sicker than he was. He then wrote to his brother telling him that they should look for someone else. However, a few of days later, he wrote to his sister,
<b>“I have found a true friend in Dr. Gachet, something like another brother, so much do we resemble each other physically and also mentally.” </b> </p>

							<p>I know there is a big differences in miles between Ireland and New Zealnd but Ireland really has some lovely scenery which is quite similar to New Zealand . This book <b>Ireland:A Lumious Beauty</b> really captures the beauty of Ireland well and I really want to capture the beauty of New Zealand through images. </p>

							<p>I know these books have nothing to do with the projects I'm doing now but I liked the typography and how straight to the point they were in telling you what the book is about.

							<h3>JCB Song</h3>
						<p>I know what you are thinking what does the JCB song have to do with a Takahe bird and Sherlock Holmes but I felt that the lyrics of the song and the video really tell a fantastic story of  the singer Luke Concannon who is reminiscencing his own childhood memories which is travelling with his dad on his JCB digger.What I felt was really clever was that it is sung from the point of view of Luke has young boy so this made the journey exciting and imaginative with seeing a tyrannosaurus rex on the journey which you obviously don't see on your own journey. I loved the animations in this video and thought they were cute and quirky and really helped tell the story of this song.    </p>

			<h3>The Lumineers</h3>
			<p>With The Lumineers being one of my favourite bands , i had to write about them. I feel that there songs and music videos tell a very good story. Songs such as Cleopatra which is inspired by a true story about a female taxi driver who, when she was younger, was proposed to. But her father had just passed away, so she didn't give her boyfriend an answer. So he left the village broken-hearted and rejected and never returned again. He was her great love and she wouldn't wash the footprints off the floor after he had left. Also the song Angela was wriiten about the leader singer Wesley Schultz's ex-girlfriend Angela Henard.He quoted that:
			<blockquote>"Although we didn't work out she still holds a place in my heart. This is why she is brought up in multiple songs."</blockquote>

						<h3>What is Typography?</h3>
<p>
Typography is  the art and technique of arranging type an also the look of a bit of text. Typography is important to the work and skills of a designer and is about much more than making the words legible. The choice of typeface and how it’s made to work and look with layout, grid, colour scheme, design theme and will make the difference between a good, bad and great design.</p>

<h3>White Space</h3>
<p>The blank areas on a page where text and illustrations are not printed. White space should be considered an important graphic element in page design.White space which is also know as negative space is the part of a page The term came from graphic design practices when printing process generally used white paper and thus the term “white space” came from the blank parts of the page that were left. It is important that white space isn’t just space that has been left blank for the sake of it. It is an important element within design practice that is used to make aesthetically pleasing compositions. If it is used incorrectly it may look as if the work is incomplete or simply badly designed. </p>

								</div>
								
       
       						</div>
							
							<p>Within adverting white space is expensive. Many companies want to get as much onto their advertisement as possible which may result in a cluttered design, but in order to make it look good it will cost them to go bigger. The likes of newspapers, yellow pages and some books really don’t take white space into consideration because they need to get as much onto one page as possible in order to cut costs. However, this lack of white space results in cramped, hard to read text which can be very frustrating for readers. It is for this reason that brans that have a tendency to be known as most “luxurious” have adverts that have a lot of white space because they want the main focus to be their product or slogan, not a busy page crammed with text. </p>
							
							
							<p> 
A fantastic example of white space at its best is the worlds leading search engine, Google. Their homepage is so simple and elegant because it used white space in such an effect way. By only having a text box and their logo, the user will not be distracted by text or images when they o to the site to search for something. Whereas on the other hand we have Yahoo, who seem as if they have never heard of white space. Their site is so busy and crammed full of information that it completely takes you of your focus of what you were going to look for in the first place. </p>

<h3>Key Principles of Typography</h3>
<p> 
Typography is what a lot of designers use when creating things. Typography is the art form and technique that entails arranging type with the purpose of making language more visible. There are five main principles of typography that I am going to explain below.
<ol>
<li>Don’t use too many typefaces</li>
<p>A typeface is a collection of fonts put together for example Arial, while a font might just be one kind of Arial like Arial Black. The difference between these two are huge and can easily be mixed up when talking about typography. The three most popular typefaces nowadays are Serif, Sans Serif and monospace. A serif is a small line attached to the end of a stroke in a letter or a symbol. If the letters and symbols of a typeface have serifs, then we call it a serif typeface. It has been said that the strokes of a serif typeface help to guide the eye when reading. Serifs are a standard when it comes to most newspapers. Sans-Serif however is said to be easier on the eye when reading online.</p>

<p>Sans Serif typefaces don’t have these thin lines hence the word “Sans” in front of Serif which means “Without” in French. Serif is known for its serious and professional look Sans Serif is known for being modern and vibrant. Because of their simplicity they are used a lot in body text as they are easy to read even in small fonts. Some examples of Sans Serif are Arial, Verdana and Tahoma. Here’s a comparison between the too. </p>
<p>Monospace which is often used in webpages as it is plainer compared to the other too and it enhances readability. Each character shares the same width hence the name Monospace. Some examples of Monospace fonts are Courier, Consolas and Andale Mono. </p>

<li>Contrast is good, but the wrong colours can make the design not look appealing and harder to read.The most common form that is encounter is text with black over a white background. However many people like to have bright colours sometimes this is not applicable because colour can make text harder to read which makes the experience less enjoyable.</li>

<p>Contrast is a good thing however keeping the background simple is a good choice as it allows for optimal results and means that the text is legible.</p>
<li>Limited use of display faces</li>
<p>Display typefaces are very interesting. However keep in mind that display typefaces were not designed to be used for bodies of text but generally require a larger font to be readable. A good way of remembering is that these faces tend to be more complex, thus tiring the viewer’s eyes easily.</p>
<li>Scannable text is a must</li>
<p>The purpose is to make sure that the text is in such good shape that the reader will keep interest long enough to read through the whole thing because they can click away at any time. The main points that will keep the users attention are things like headers, graphical elements and pieces of emphasised text. The main things that will impact how scannable your text is the focus points like text size and contrast.</p>
<li>Don’t distort typefaces</li>
<p>Sometimes individuals feel the need to make text fit a certain area by stretching the text however this is not always the best thing to do as this takes away from the legibility which takes away from what is being created</p>
</ol>

<h4>Christopher Wool</h4>

<p>Christopher Wool was born in 1955, Boston is an American typography artist living and working in New York City, Christopher Wool uses a wide range of techniques and style in his works. He is, however, best known in the typographic world for his striking, large-scale paintings of black-stencilled type on white canvas backgrounds. These pieces often have phrases with the words abbreviated, disrupted and in grid format, making it slightly more difficult for the viewer to perceive and make sense of the piece as a whole. I liked how simple the typography and it was in a grid format as it is the grid format that I am considering doing to my website</p>

						<h3>Psycho Opening Credits</h3>
							<p>

The opening credits of Saul Bass’ Physic has become completely infamous. By using a series of white bars to move in the sans-serif titles and then escort them back out a very simple yet effective title sequence is created. The white bars come from different parts of the screen and never break their formation or cross each other which completely represented Bass’ restrictions of “every object has a path from which it does not deviate. On, off, left, right, up, down, black, white"

										<h3>Forrest Gump</h3>
<p>	This film is based on the life of Forrest Gump who may not be the brightest person in the world and what some may call "slow" but he has lived an interesting life.The story is told through Forrest Gump eyes.It follows this one very simple, very kind man through every important historical event of the last several decades. He participates in it but almost as an outsider due to his lack of full understanding of the specifics. Because of Gump’s disinterest in the bad, we get a telling of history without any cynicism in the mix – a child’s perspective. </p>

	<p>What I thought was great about Fight Club was David Fincher is trying to convey through this movie is neither extreme materialistic lifestyle nor the carefree 'I don't give a shit' attitude which is provided by Tyler's character in this movie is right. You have to find the middle ground and support your conscience.

						<div class="content">

<h3></h3>
<p>HTML5 is the latest version of Hypertext Markup Language, the code that describes web pages. It's actually three kinds of code: HTML, which provides the structure; Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), which take care of presentation; and JavaScript, which makes things happen.HTML5 has been designed to deliver almost everything you'd want to do online without requiring additional software such as browser plugins.Reading through the Guidelines on github it really talks about the importance of accessibility which shouldn't be an afterthought. You don't have to be a WCAG expert to improve your website, you can start immediately by fixing the little things that make a huge difference, such as:
<ul>
<li>learning to use the alt attribute properly</li>
<li>making sure your links and buttons are marked as such (no div class=button)</li>
<li>not relying exclusively on colors to communicate information</li>
<li>explicitly labelling form controls</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>This video here is a great help to understand HTML5</p>

						<h3></h3>
                            <p>I know packaging has nothing to do with a website but I feel that the use of typography,colour and spacing used to design the packaging is very good to help me consider these factors on my own websites</p>

<p>The packaging on an on a box or a parcel is the first thing that a person sees whenever they first see the package itself.  This is on of the reasons why the packaging is so important and crucial for a customer to be satisfied with the package and make the package more exciting to open. In order to make sure that you have good packaging on your product you need to include things such as a unique and also fancy logo that will stand out on the packaging itself so that the packaging is attractive and not too boring for the customer. Another thing that is important whenever making packaging is the unique design that should be included on the logo itself to make the logo stand out from other different packages and also that the packaging is unique and looks colourful and presentable to the customer.</p>
<h3>Examples of  Packaging</h3>
                            <h4>Kallo</h4>
                            
                        <p>Pearlfisher created a new brand identity for Kallo. Kallo are a leading natural and organic food company. The packaging of the Kallo brand is professional looking as it clearly displays the contents of the packages but they also made use of geometric shapes and different shapes of colours to make it look like the shapes are connected. The packaging is stylish enough that customers can place them in their kitchens. The bold text is innovative and eye-catching against the light coloured background.</p>

                            <p>Pearlfisher created a brand for Cadburys, a brand which has been around for many years. The Cadburys branding is iconic around the world for their chocolate. The brand was made more contemporary using custom typography which then give every bar an individual style but whilst still keeping the traditional look of the old Cadbury brand. The new branding has allowed Cadbury to reinvent themselves and also ensured that shoppers around the world would know the brand.</p>

                            <p>The founders of “Innocent Smoothies” are Richard Reed, Adam Balon and Jon Wright, there whole branding ideas have been built on re-using recyclable plastic bottles. The branding symbol that the company used is iconic and takes a stand for people to drink healthier and also to look after the planet while doing so. The company uses a white background and uses coloured text. The use of the coloured text against the white background makes an automatic impact as the letters stand out and are very eye-catching.</p>

Alpro specialises in dairy free products for those who have intolerances as well as doing other products. Alpro uses ‘plant power’ as a way to show that they use natural ingredients in their products. The designing of the packaging promotes a positive natural vibe. The use of white as a background and the introduction of the green leaves with the addition of holistic white going through the leaves creates an image of freshness. The font colour used in the design of the Alpro products are all promoting a fresh and natural vibe which enhances the company’s purpose and ensures that the company has a globalised brand.</p>

The colours that is used within the actual packaging I feel that the colours are bright and I feel like it would match the idea that I am looking to do in my own design and also website. I feel like the spacing of the text on the box would also be good for my own design and would make the designs stand out. This packaging idea is made by Stockholm Design Lab and this packaging is owned by Askul Packaging.</p>

<p>A grid subdivides a page vertically and horizontally into margins, columns, inter-column spaces, lines of type, and spaces between blocks of type and images. These subdivisions form the basis of a modular and systematic approach to the layout, particularly for multipage documents, making the design process quicker, and ensuring visual consistency between related pages. structures in which their sensibility can flourish. It is commonly seen in newspaper and magazine layout with columns of text and images. One grid, or a collection of grids, may be used across an entire project to achieve a consistent look and feel. In a finished product, the grid is invisible, but following it helps in creating good print and web layouts. There is no limit to the grid layouts that can be created. Common types include equally sized two, three and four-column grids with a header across the top, as well as a full-page grid of squares. From these building blocks, the variation of column widths, borders, page size and other features of the grid will lead to unique page design.</p>
<h3>Examples of Grid Based Layouts used in Graphic Design are:</h3>

							<h2>The Golden Ratio</h2>
							<h6></h6>
						</header>
						<div class="content">

<h3></h3>
<p>The  Golden Ratio is one where the ratio of the smaller segment to the larger segment is the same as the larger segment to the sum of both segments. This is more easily seen in a simple diagram.

<p>It’s believed that the Golden Ratio has been in use for at least 4,000 years in human art and design, but it may be even longer than that – some people argue that the Ancient Egyptians used the principle to build the pyramids.
In more contemporary times, the Golden Ratio can be observed in music, art, and design all around you. By applying a similar working methodology you can bring the same design sensibilities to your own work. Here are just a couple of examples of The Golden Ratio:
<h3>The Parthenon</h3>
<div class="gallery">
								<div>
									<div class="image fit flush">
										<a href="images/pic15.jpg"><img src="images/pic15.jpg" width="600" height="300" alt="" /></a>
									</div>
								</div>
								
       
       						</div>
<p>Ancient Greek architecture used the Golden Ratio to determine pleasing dimensional relationships between the width of a building and its height, the size of the portico and even the position of the columns supporting the structure.
The final result is a building that feels entirely in proportion. The neo-classical architecure movement reused these principles too.</p>
<h3>The Last Supper</h3>
<div class="gallery">
								<div>
									<div class="image fit flush">
										<a href="images/pic16.jpg"><img src="images/pic16.jpg" width="600" height="300" alt="" /></a>
									</div>
								</div>
								
       
       						</div>
<p>Leonardo da Vinci, like many other artists throughout the ages, made extensive use of the Golden Ratio to create pleasing compositions.
In the last supper, the figures are arranged in the lower two thirds (the larger of the two parts of the Golden Ratio), and the position of Jesus is perfectly plotted by arranging golden rectangles across the canvas.</p>
<h3>Nature</h3>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kkGeOWYOFoA" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>There are also numerous examples of the Golden Ratio in nature – you can observe the ratio all around you. Flowers, sea-shells, pineapples, and even honeycombs all exhibit the same principle ratio in their make-up.
So using the Golden Ratio in your design work is both appropriate and foreshadowed in our everyday environment.</p>

							<h2>UX and UI design</h2>
							<h6></h6>
						</header>
						<div class="content">

<h3></h3>
<p>To be honest I have heard of the term UX and UI dsign but never really fully understood what they were and the different between the  two so I have taken a look to understand what they mean.</p>
		<p>UX Design refers to the term User Experience Design, while UI Design stands for User Interface Design. Both elements are crucial to a product and work closely together. But despite their professional relationship, the roles themselves are quite different, referring to very different parts of the process and the design discipline. Where UX Design is a more analytical and technical field, UI Design is closer to what we refer to as graphic design, though the responsibilities are somewhat more complex.</p>
<P>There is an analogy I like to use in describing the different parts of a (digital) product:
If you imagine a product as the human body, the bones represent the code which give it structure. The organs represent the UX design: measuring and optimizing against input for supporting life functions. And UI design represents the cosmetics of the body–its presentation, its senses and reactions.
But don’t worry if you’re still confused! You’re not the only one!</p>
<p>As Rahul Varshney, Co-creator of Foster.fm puts it:
<blockquote>User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI) are some of the most confused and misused terms in our field. A UI without UX is like a painter slapping paint onto canvas without thought; while UX without UI is like the frame of a sculpture with no paper mache on it. A great product experience starts with UX followed by UI. Both are essential for the product’s success.</blockquote>

							<h2>Flat vs Realism</h2>
							<h6></h6>
						</header>
						<div class="content">

<h3></h3>
<p> Flat design and realistic design. Both are completely different and both can be equally effective in term of design. It has been disputed a lot over which one is better, flat or realism? Each style have different purposes and so it is completely subjective. </p>
 <div class="gallery">
								<div>
									<div class="image fit flush">

       						</div>
 
<p>Realism really comes into play when things need to be as realistic as possible. Take a plane simulator or a surgeons training simulator for example. They need to be as actual and realistic as possible so that the training that is provided is an effective as it can be. This is so that when the person does the real thing they will have some idea of what to expect. If something like a plane simulator was created using flat design it probably wouldn’t work very well at all and would cause a lot of confusion for the trainee. A realistic environment is essential for things like that. 
The idea of realism (also known as skeuomorphism) came from trying to make replicas of real life items or objects. It came about during web 2.0 when Steve Jobs designed the iPhone. Things such as buttons were designed to look as real as possible by using shadows, highlights and other details in order to make them look three dimensional on a flat surface. Skeuomorphism was created in order to things look familiar so that users would be more comfortable with how to go about using them. </p>
<div class="gallery">

									</div>
								</div>
								
       
       						</div>
 
<p>Skeuomorphism was often used within computer programs within their user interfaces in order to recreate a familiar look to real life controls. A popular example of this was within music editing software where they would closely replicate musical instruments and equipment. The buttons, knobs, sliders and other such controls would be almost perfect duplicates of the ones found on physical devices. It even got to the point where things such as screws and hands would be added on to give as realistic look even though they had no purpose within the user interface. One of the first apps on the iPhone was the calculator app. This app was made to look almost identical to our everyday real life calculator. This was so that people would automatically understand what it was and what to do with it because it looked like a calculator, but it was on a flat screen. </p>

       						</div>
  
  
<p>Flat design is also known as a form of minimalist design. It is a style that completely removes any stylistic approaches that would give the look of a three dimensional object such as shadows or gradients. It is generally used in order to enhance the actual usability of an application rather than it look. Flat design is often described as simple, colourful, modern and clean. Illustrations are fall simpler and less complex which results in faster loading times. As well as that, using flat style often results in the content being presented in a much simpler and easy to understand manner. </p>

       						</div>
<p>The flat style was inspired from the international Typographic style, which is also known as the swiss style as well as Modernism. Aspects of these art movements from the 1950s and 1960s have been heavily incorporated into flat design that we use today, over fifty-five years later. </p>

<p>During 2006, Microsoft sealed a mp3 music player called Zune which incorporated elements of flat design. It was clean and simple which made it an easy interface to use. In 2010, Microsoft once again used this flat style when they released the Windows phone 7. The interface within the Windows phone 7 incorporated the use of large coloured tiles, flat imagery and sans-serif typography. This simplistic look was then completed with the use of a grid menu which made it easy to make a selection. This use of slat style appeared to be popular and was well liked and so they used it within the release of Windows 8, Microsoft 365 and the Xbox 360 interfaces. It wasn't until 2013 that Apple decided to follow in Microsofts footsteps and moved away from skeuomorphic design and adapted the flat design look with iOS 7. </p>

       						</div>
<h3>Why is skeuomorphic design fading away?</h3>
<p>Generally skeuomorphic interfaces tend to take up more screen face than those created using the flat style. One point that has been noted is that skeuomorphic interfaces very rarely have numeric input or feedback which many users will rely on to know if the interface has worked correctly or not. Whilst apple was run by Steve Jobs, it was well known for their heavy usage of skeuomorphic design within their interfaces and applications. It wasn’t until after Steve Jobs had died that Apple looked into whether or not it was a good idea to continue with their incorporation of skeuomorphic design with their new products. It was this debate and decision to move onto a more simplified design that may have resulted in the resignation of Scott Forstall who had been described as "the most vocal and high-ranking proponent of the visual design style favoured by Mr. Jobs”. </p>

<h3>Flat vs. Realism </h3>
In 2014 a company named inTacto created an absolutely extraordinary website called Flat Vs. Realism that really takes flat design and skeuomorphism to their limits. They game up with the idea a making a game that had a similar style to “Street Fighter” to illustrate the on going battle begin skeuomorphism and flat design. 
<blockquote>“We created a story which metaphorically narrated what we felt was taking place in the world of digital design “ </blockquote>
      <div class="gallery">

									</div>
								</div>
								
       
       						</div>
<p>They felt that having a game alone would not be enough and so they decided to create a story that illustrated how this battle came about. In order to find inspiration for both flat design and skeuomorphism they relied a lot on Pinterest (which is one of my absolute favourite sites). After taking in what they found they began creating their characters in their approbate styles. During the entire process the team bumped into a few problems along the way. One of the team's main problems was being able to insert a HTML5 game in the middle of a parallax scroll. After brainstorming for a while they were able to overcome this hurdle and move on. The end result is amazing and the narrative experience is second to none. I actually got a lot of inspiration from viewing this site which I will try to incorporate into my own narrative website. </p>

							<h2>Moodboard</h2>
							<h6></h6>
						</header>
						<div class="content">

<h3></h3>
<p>A mood board is a digital collage or a physical collage that helps define the direction of a website. A mock up, on the other hand, is a more concrete version of a website which is only a few stops aways from the finished design. In a mood board you can decide the actual visual and UI elements of a website. Among the samples you can put in a mood board are;</p>
<ul>
<li>Images</li>
<li>Photography </li>
<li>Fonts </li>
<li>Colours </li>
<li>Graphics </li>
<li>Patterns </li>
<li>Text </li>
<li>Maps </li>
</ul>
<p>Mood boards are fluid, there is nothing set in stone. The whole idea of them is to gather ideas and inspiration before jumping into formal design. It can determine the direction you can take with your website; for example professional or playful,or the tone you might take which could be light or dark. </p>
<h3>Benefits</h3>
<p>It helps to avoid any misunderstanding that may stem from trying to describe something verbally. The mood board sets out your thoughts clearly and it shows how you interpret your ideas. By pinning down colours, fonts, images and overall tone, adding the design to the wire frames becomes much easier and as a result, it makes the whole process smoother. 
With the content in hand, the mood board allows you to focus on design. You really don’t want great content stuck in an unattractive site. The goal is to keep your mood board design focused as possible, but we must remember they are not the design. Your prototype is your design. One last thing to remember is that mood boards do not communicate the final content. </p>

<p>Has this this is a narrative and storytelling module I realised that our own history in Northern Ireland is kind of like storytelling because growing up you hear different stories from family memebers who grew up in the troubles and everyone has different experiences and tales to share. Also recently I went to the Ulster Museum where they had the Good Friday agreement exhibition.It showed Northern Ireland's recent past through a range of objects reflecting diverse perspectives and experiences. With political posters and ephemera, many of which date from the early to mid-1970s. There are also many examples of prison-made objects, badges and artworks. The collection is designed to explore politics and conflict and the impact of both on everyday life, people and communities. </p>

							<h2>The Psychology of Transition</h2>
							<h6></h6>
						</header>
						<div class="content">

<h3></h3>
<p> In essence, interaction is some form of action that happens between two or more objects that has an effect on each other.The idea of the two-way effect is the basis of interaction. Interaction is the communication between anything that is between two or more things. For example, two people having a conversation or two cats fighting. Interaction is also feedback. For example, ringing a telephone, a driver being in control of a vehicle dictates where the vehicle is positioned. </p>

       						</div>
<p>Human computer interaction also known as HCI is the overall study, design, and uses of the interfaces between users and the actual computers. Human computer interaction has been often considered as the crossover of computing sciences, design and media studies all combined. The term was first used in 1975 within a book. It was then popularised when it was noted in an IBM research book by Thomas P. Moran during 1983. Within aspects of design, human computer interaction and software development, interaction design (also known as IxD) is basically how we go about creating digital things for users to use effectively. Interaction design has been said to be 
<blockquote>“the practice of designing interactive digital products, environments, systems and services” </blockquote>
 
<h3>Transitions within User Experience Design </h3>
When it comes to websites many are a lot more successful than other, whether its due to their content, features, design or usability. One of the most important aspects of websites today is the incorporation of interaction design along with animation. It is these small yet highly valuable details that can improve a website tenfold. 
For years people have been designing websites and digital products, working with design applications such as Sketch, Photoshop or Illustrator. Many people within the industry understand that design is more than just how something appears, it is about how it actually works and works with the user. Steve Jobs once said that 
<blockquote>“It’s not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.“ </blockquote>
<p>Our opinion and experience of a certain product is moulded by various factors, whether it’s a website or a football, interaction is a very important aspect of this experience. it has gotten to the stage where we can no loner rely on a static page, or even have a static page and add in a few animations later down the line. We now have to design with the aspect of interaction and animation are the forefront. </p>
<h3>Animated Scrolling</h3>
Animated scrolling is one of the most useful and smart aspects of interaction within a website. Before it came about we relied on internal hyperlinks that would bring you straight to the part of the page you needed. On one hand this was great because you got where you wanted to go and fast. On the other there is often a loss of content in that you may not understand that part of the website. This is because you have missed parts on the journey down, it is like skipping chapter five in a book before reading the first five. Whenever you miss a chapter you may miss something and therefore may end up lacking knowledge about the later content. Animated scrolling takes the user to the part of the site they require by quickly scrolling through all the parts before it. By doing this the user can get a visual representation of how much content was missed and therefore know what they may be skipping.

       						</div>
<h3>Pull to Refresh</h3>
With the introduction of the iPhone, there was also the introduction of the “pull to refresh” feature. This simple yet highly useful feature allows the user to update their scrollable content in reverse-chronological order. This feature has been incorporated into many apps today some of which include Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and Reddit. Before this feature was created users had to rely on pressing refresh button each time they wanted to check for new content.

       						</div>
<h3>Content Based Hiding </h3>
Google Chrome has a feature which hides the browser chrome whenever the user scrolls down. Once the user scrolls back up the chrome reappears. This nifty feature allows the user to focus more on the content of the webpage and not be distracted by a browser chrome. As well as that, there is an increase in screen space because the browser chrome isn’t taking up valuable webpage space.

These small and subtle yet really useful features can really improve a users experience when they are used correctly. By taking the time and thinking about what the user wants and needs from a webpage we can design for that and incorporate aspects that will make the user feel more involved and welcomed to the website.

							<h2>Best Practices for Speeding Up Your Web Site</h2>
							<h6></h6>

						<h3>Minimize HTTP Requests</h3>
<p>80% of the end-user response time is spent on the front-end. Most of this time is tied up in downloading all the components in the page: images, stylesheets, scripts, Flash, etc. Reducing the number of components in turn reduces the number of HTTP requests required to render the page. This is the key to faster pages. 
One way to reduce the number of components in the page is to simplify the page's design. But is there a way to build pages with richer content while also achieving fast response times? Here are some techniques for reducing the number of HTTP requests, while still supporting rich page designs.</p>
<p>Combined files are a way to reduce the number of HTTP requests by combining all scripts into a single script, and similarly combining all CSS into a single stylesheet. Combining files is more challenging when the scripts and stylesheets vary from page to page, but making this part of your release process improves response times.</p>
<p>CSS Sprites are the preferred method for reducing the number of image requests. Combine your background images into a single image and use the CSS background-image and background-position properties to display the desired image segment.
Image maps combine multiple images into a single image. The overall size is about the same, but reducing the number of HTTP requests speeds up the page. Image maps only work if the images are contiguous in the page, such as a navigation bar. Defining the coordinates of image maps can be tedious and error prone. Using image maps for navigation is not accessible too, so it's not recommended.</p>
		
		<h3>Put Stylesheets at the Top</h3>
	<p>Moving stylesheets to the document HEAD makes pages appear to be loading faster. This is because putting stylesheets in the HEAD allows the page to render progressively. 
Front-end engineers that care about performance want a page to load progressively; that is, we want the browser to display whatever content it has as soon as possible. This is especially important for pages with a lot of content and for users on slower Internet connections. The importance of giving users visual feedback, such as progress indicators, has been well researched and documented. In our case the HTML page is the progress indicator! When the browser loads the page progressively the header, the navigation bar, the logo at the top, etc. all serve as visual feedback for the user who is waiting for the page. This improves the overall user experience.
The problem with putting stylesheets near the bottom of the document is that it prohibits progressive rendering in many browsers, including Internet Explorer. These browsers block rendering to avoid having to redraw elements of the page if their styles change. The user is stuck viewing a blank white page. </p>
			<h3>Put Scripts at the Bottom</h3>	
<p>The problem caused by scripts is that they block parallel downloads. The HTTP/1.1 specification suggests that browsers download no more than two components in parallel per hostname. If you serve your images from multiple hostnames, you can get more than two downloads to occur in parallel. While a script is downloading, however, the browser won't start any other downloads, even on different hostnames. 
In some situations it's not easy to move scripts to the bottom. If, for example, the script uses document.write to insert part of the page's content, it can't be moved lower in the page. There might also be scoping issues. In many cases, there are ways to workaround these situations.
An alternative suggestion that often comes up is to use deferred scripts. The DEFER attribute indicates that the script does not contain document.write, and is a clue to browsers that they can continue rendering. Unfortunately, Firefox doesn't support the DEFER attribute. In Internet Explorer, the script may be deferred, but not as much as desired. If a script can be deferred, it can also be moved to the bottom of the page. That will make your web pages load faster.</p>	
<h3>Make JavaScript and CSS External</h3>	
<p>Using external files in the real world generally produces faster pages because the JavaScript and CSS files are cached by the browser. JavaScript and CSS that are inlined in HTML documents get downloaded every time the HTML document is requested. This reduces the number of HTTP requests that are needed, but increases the size of the HTML document. On the other hand, if the JavaScript and CSS are in external files cached by the browser, the size of the HTML document is reduced without increasing the number of HTTP requests. </p>

<h3></h3>
<p>It was when I was reading my friends travel blog who is currently travelling round Australia and New Zealand was when I had my idea of making my website similar to a blog.where they have different sections for each topic but instead of having them on separate pages I plan to keep it all in one.</p>	

 <div class="gallery">

									<div class="image fit flush">
										<a href="images/pic61.png"><img src="images/pic61.png" width="600" height="300" alt="" /></a>
									</div>
								</div>
								
       
       						</div>	

<p>When I started looking at other travel blogs I noticed a pattern and that they mainlyused big images to show off all the places they have been to and with some text explaining their experience. I noticed that with a lot of these blogs that they had a clean design and very simple to navigate.But also noticed some of them were a bit old fashioned in there design so I hope to make my look more modern.</p>

<h3>Responsive Frameworks</h3>
<p>

Responsive web design is becoming something that is almost expected when the user accesses a website. With the vast amount of devices being used into in order to access the web, it is important that the websites you create, will create a similar user experience no matter what device the website is accessed on. There are many tools available today that give you some code that will automatically make a website responsive. Theses are called frameworks. There are a few different types of framework and below I will talk about a few
For my bird project I have decided to try to make it responsive and I have decided to look at a framework that I could use in order to help me to do this. Below are some of the options that I had and the reason why I did or did not choose to use it.
