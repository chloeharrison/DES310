          <p>This little web site is a homage to the Holmes' story and was created as a piece of coursework for 
the <a href="http://ixdbelfast.org/"target="_blank">BDes (Hons) Interaction Design</a> programme at the Belfast School of Art.
Standing on the shoulders of giants we are indebted to Ethan Marcotte who kindly granted his 
permission to develop his original site, designed 
for A List Apart way back in 2010 when Marcotte 
coined the term <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-

Conan Doyle's writings lives on from generation to generation. As Scott Monty puts it:
<blockquote>"Every generation or so some kind of cycle
happens, some big book or movie begins to start the 
    process and then others seem to follow up,".-<b>Scott Monty a member of the Sherlock Holmes Enthusiast Group 'Baker Street Irregulars'</b></blockquote>
